# Description:
#   Basic SR-IOV test that checks if VF can send and receive broadcast packets
# Steps:
#    Use ping for testing & tcpdump to check if the packets were received
#    On the 2nd VM – tcpdump -i bond0 -c 10 ip proto \\icmp > out.client
#    On the TEST VM – ping -b $broadcastAddress -c 13 &
#    On the 2nd VM – cat out.client | grep $broadcastAddress
#    If $?=0 test passed!
